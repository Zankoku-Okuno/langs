PoC Languages
-------------

Because I need to know I can at least implement existing languages and type systems before I try to invent my own.
Besides, who doesn't want interpreters/compilers for the theoretical foundations of programming langauges?

Requirements
============

* ghc version 8+
* cabal 1.24+
